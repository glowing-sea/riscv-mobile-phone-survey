## Abstract

**Title**: Exploring the Viability of Widespread Adoption of RISC-V Architecture in Mobile Phones: Prospects and Challenges

**Keywords**: Instruction Set Architecture, RISC-V, Feasibility Study, Mobile Phones

**Type**: Independent Project

**Duration**: Feb 2023 – May 2023

**Course Name**: [COMP4450](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2023/course/comp4450) – Advanced Computing Research Methods

**Course Outline**:

- Each student in this course had to independently identify a research gap and begin conducting the research while learning essential research techniques through lectures. The final presentation was also critically evaluated by another peer. ([reference](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2023/course/COMP4450/First%20Semester/2696))

**Course Final Mark**: 90 / 100

**Project Weight**: [100%](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2023/course/COMP4450/First%20Semester/2696) of COMP4450

**Description**: 
- This project performs a systematic survey on the adaptability of the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) on mobile phones, through the aspects of intrinsic properties (e.g., performance, openness, modularity, and security), hardware ecosystem (e.g., product line availability and academic and industrial research activeness), and software ecosystem (e.g., emulator, operating system, and compiler support).
- The outcome is significant for investors and engineers planning to support RISC-V mobile phones, as well as for domain researchers seeking to identify specific research gaps, such as the lack of a benchmark study for physical RISC-V chips.
- The project addresses a research gap: few academic studies have discussed RISC-V and mobile phones, while news and blog articles have addressed some of it. By May 2023, searching the ACM, CNKI, and IEEE databases for “RISC-V” and “mobile phone” returned no results.
- The survey is designed to be undertaken through an extensive literature review, case study, and reading of industry and technical specification reports, and a final SWOT analysis summarising the internal and external factors affecting the feasibility of adopting RISC-V in mobile phones.
- The survey evaluation focuses on the quality of the collected data and the selected analysis methods.
- The project reveals that while RISC-V has been receiving increasing attention due to its open and modular features and has obtained basic development toolkit support, the fragmentation issue, low availability of RISC-V high-performance general-purpose CPUs, and far less investment support compared to its rivals, ARM and x86, have impeded its widespread adoption in mobile phones in the near future. Even so, the slowdown in semiconductor advances and the growing popularity of teaching RISC-V in university courses have provided RISC-V with a bright future, potentially entering the mobile phone market.
- Future work includes conducting user surveys, domain expert interviews, and collaborating with researchers with economic backgrounds to strengthen and expand the findings.
